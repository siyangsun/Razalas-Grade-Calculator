# Razalas-Grade-Calculator
--
Odracir Razalas teaches a programming language called SULP-SULP-EES at IELEISULL (a 4-year university located in a place known as Ainrofilac, ASU). He hopes that by disclosing some grading guidelines in his syllabus, students know precisely how many points they need to score in their exams, assignments, etc., to earn the grade they want. However, for some reason at the end of the quarter some students seem to have trouble computing their final scores. The goal is to write Qt program that calculates the grade of a student.
